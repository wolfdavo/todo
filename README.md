## Usage

This app is designed to be a super simple, optimized to-do list that does smart auto-prioritizing for you. It will keep 10 auto-generated task suggestions in your backlog all the time so you never run out of things to do. If a task is AI generated, it will have a âœ¨.

### Adding a todo

When something pops up that you need to get done, just type ```/todo I need to get my emails done or something similar in here``` while the app is running and it will add it to you backlog of tasks.

### Getting Current Task

This app is designed to give you one, most important task at a time. To see the current task, use the ```/current``` command.

### Marking current task as complete

When you are done with the current task, type ```/done``` to mark it as complete and get the next one.

### View task backlog

If you'd like to see all the tasks you have in the queue, with their priority scores, use the ```/backlog``` command.
